# Unveiling High-Ranking Website Attributes for Good Performance in Google SERP

## 1 - Introduction

### 1.1 - Executive Summary

The primary focus of this study is to understand how various website attributes and technologies influence a website's ranking on Google Search Engine Results Pages (SERP). Utilizing the comprehensive dataset from HTTP Archive, the research endeavors to pinpoint the metrics and characteristics integral to achieving superior ranking positions on Google. The aim is to uncover actionable insights for creating efficient, top-performing websites aligned with SEO, marketing, and business goals to enhance online visibility and economic efficiency in site development and maintenance.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Correlation Between Metrics and Website Rank:** The study reveals that no single metric strongly correlates with website rank; however, attributes like quick load times and a lower count of image requests have a negative correlation with rank, implying these factors could positively influence ranking.

2. **Impact of Certain Metrics on SEO:** Optimizations leading to improved website performance, such as faster load times and efficient data usage, are identified as positive contributors to better rankings. Efficiency in content delivery and adoption of modern web practices are highlighted as vital for competitive rankings.

3. **Technology's Influence on Rank:** The research suggests that the choice of technology has a notable impact on a website's rank, with higher-ranked sites utilizing technologies that boost performance, security, and informed decision-making.

4. **Page Load Performance:** A nuanced relationship is observed between the number of requests a webpage makes and its load performance. Fast-loading websites tend to have more requests, underscoring the importance of efficient request management over sheer quantity.

5. **Predictive Model Challenges:** Despite a promising model accuracy for rank prediction, challenges persist due to the dataset's imbalanced nature, especially for higher-ranked websites, and reliance on a singular dominant feature, indicating the complexity in reliably forecasting page ranks.

**Actionable Insights:**

- Emphasize optimizing site load times through reduced and efficiently handled requests, and strategic resource utilization.
  
- Efficient content and resource management strategies, including image compression, utilization of modern file formats, and optimization of code, are crucial.
  
- Adherence to modern web standards and practices and the integration of efficient web technologies are recommended to enhance user experience and SEO rankings.
  
- Incorporate data-driven insights into SEO strategies to prioritize optimization efforts aimed at improving user experience and consequently, rankings.

**Challenges and Future Directions:**

The study faces challenges due to an imbalanced dataset with underrepresented top-ranked websites and the exclusion of potentially influential data due to constraints. Future improvements involve balancing the dataset, expanding feature investigation, and incorporating additional insightful metrics, aiming for a more accurate and holistic understanding of website ranking factors.

This research serves as a foundational step towards optimizing website performance in alignment with Google's ranking preferences, offering a pathway for stakeholders to make informed decisions for enhanced online presence and operational efficiency.

### 1.4 - Data Source: HTTP Archive Dataset

**Data Source:** Dataset was downloaded from [httparchive.org](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/httparchive.org/tree/main)

The HTTP Archive is a project that keeps track of how websites are built https://httparchive.org/. It does this by regularly visiting popular websites and recording a bunch of data about them, including:

* The different resources that make up the website (like images, scripts, and stylesheets)
* How long it takes to load these resources
* The technologies that the website uses

This data is then stored and made available for anyone to download or analyze. Researchers, web developers, and anyone else interested in how websites work can use this data to learn more about the current state of the web and how it's changing over time.
